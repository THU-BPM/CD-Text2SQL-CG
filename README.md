* This is the combined generalization test set generated by sparc and cosql based on the validation set, and its detailed parameters are the numbers of SPARC-CG and COSQL-CG in the table below.

* Question is the total number of questions, # CG Questions is the number of questions that meet the definition of compositional generalization and # Non-CG Questions is the number of in-domain questions (the templates and combination of templates are both seen in training).
* In a turn with a key called "cg," if the value of the key is true, it's a CG question, while if it is false, it is a non-cg question. If there is no key named "cg" in the turn of a conversation, it is an irrelevant question used to form a context.
